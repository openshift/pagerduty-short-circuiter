# pagerduty-short-circuiter
This project contains Pagerduty-CLI to reduce the time taken from when SRE receives a PD alert to when troubleshooting on the cluster actually begins

The CLI application, called as pdcli will have three sub-commands:

- pdcli login
- pdcli alerts
- pdcli oncall

# Installation

# Activating shell completions
Run the following to see instructions for various shells:
