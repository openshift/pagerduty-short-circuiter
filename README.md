# PagerDuty Short Circuiter
This project contains PagerDuty CLI to reduce the time taken from when SRE receives a PD alert to when troubleshooting on the cluster actually begins.

The CLI application, called as `pdcli` will have three sub-commands:

- pdcli login
- pdcli alerts
- pdcli oncall

## Activating shell completions
Run the following to see instructions for various shells:
`$ pdcli completion --help`
